; The reaper thread will check every 5 seconds for exited clients, for config file changes, and for the CPU/iGPU power balance

; The desired governor is used when entering GameMode instead of "performance"

; The default governor is used when leaving GameMode instead of restoring the original value
;defaultgov=powersave

; The iGPU desired governor is used when the integrated GPU is under heavy load
igpu_desiredgov=powersave
; Threshold to use to decide when the integrated GPU is under heavy load.
; This is a ratio of iGPU Watts / CPU Watts which is used to determine when the
; integraged GPU is under heavy enough load to justify switching to
; igpu_desiredgov.  Set this to -1 to disable all iGPU checking and always
; use desiredgov for games.

; GameMode can change the scheduler policy to SCHED_ISO on kernels which support it (currently
; not supported by upstream kernels). Can be set to "auto", "on" or "off". "auto" will enable
; with 4 or more CPU cores. "on" will always enable. Defaults to "off".
softrealtime=auto

; GameMode can renice game processes. You can put any value between 0 and 20 here, the value
; will be negated and applied as a nice value (0 means no change). Defaults to 0.
; To use this feature, the user must be added to the gamemode group (and then rebooted):
; sudo usermod -aG gamemode $(whoami)
renice=0

; By default, GameMode adjusts the iopriority of clients to BE/0, you can put any value
; between 0 and 7 here (with 0 being highest priority), or one of the special values
; "off" (to disable) or "reset" (to restore Linux default behavior based on CPU priority),
; currently, only the best-effort class is supported thus you cannot set it here
ioprio=0

; Sets whether gamemode will inhibit the screensaver when active
; Defaults to 1

; Sets whether gamemode will disable split lock mitigation when active
; Defaults to 1

; Parking or Pinning can be enabled with either "yes", "true" or "1" and disabled with "no", "false" or "0".
; Either can also be set to a specific list of cores to park or pin, comma separated list where "-" denotes
; a range. E.g "park_cores=1,8-15" would park cores 1 and 8 to 15.
; The default is uncommented is to disable parking but enable pinning. If either is enabled the code will
; currently only properly autodetect Ryzen 7900x3d, 7950x3d and Intel CPU:s with E- and P-cores.
